# Tagger Bath - Python Backend

Tagger Bath is a location based, team oriented, 'land grab' game where you are assigned a team and must capture real world locations by walking towards them. This game was designed to encourage physical activity through competition.

This repo is home to the Python code which ran the backend of the application which ran on Google App Engine.

The repo for the [front end Android app can be found here](https://github.com/SLClayton/TaggerBath_App).
